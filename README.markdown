# Push-to-talk for Skype (on Linux)

This application allows one to assign a key, that while pushed, will unmute one's microphone in a skype conversation.

By default, this application listens for the F1 key, but can be configured to listen for any key by using the '--keycode' option, and setting your ``PUSH_TO_TALK_KEYCODE`` environment variable.
