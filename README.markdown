# Push-to-talk for Skype (on Linux)

This application allows one to assign a key, that while pushed, will unmute one's microphone in a skype conversation.

By default, this application listens for the F1 key, but can be configured to listen
to any X11 keycode by entering that keycode into a file at ``~/.push_to_talk_key``.

At the moment, this application provides no facility for providing you with the X11 keycode, but that is planned for future development.

## Installation

 - Run ``install.sh`` with administrator privileges.
 - Right-click on your gnome panel.
 - Select 'Add to panel'.
 - Add 'Skype Push-to-talk'.
